# Comments About This Course

I think that this course should provide some plots to help visualise the differences between the models. I know that, as a Data Scientist, sometimes you have to work UI-less and in terminal only. But, for beginners, I really think some visual data could go long way. 

I'll try to edit it in my files if I have some time. There will be an update here if that happens.
